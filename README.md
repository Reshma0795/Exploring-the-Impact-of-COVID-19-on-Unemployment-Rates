# Unemployment-Rate-Analysis-in-Python

In this project I am analyzing unemployment rate in Python.

Unemployment is measured by the unemployment rate which is the number of people who are unemployed as a percentage of the total labour force. We have seen a sharp increase in the unemployment rate during Covid-19. The dataset used here contains data on Indiaâ€™s unemployment rate during Covid-19. The dataset has been taken from source: https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2021/07/12/unemployment-analysis-with-python/
